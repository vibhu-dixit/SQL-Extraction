--- Question 1/50 ---
Entity/Table: Rudi_Altig
Question: Which year did Rudi_Altig won the first medal?
Expected: 1965
Detected Pattern: 1
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 1: Single Year Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cyclist
- Data Types: 3 numeric, 23 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:
- Ratio: SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, 1, INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL) / NULLIF(CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, INSTR(column_name, '/') + 1, INSTR(column_name, ' ') - INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL), 0)
- Ranking: SELECT CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(rank_column, 'st', ''), 'nd', ''), 'rd', ''), 'th', '') AS INTEGER)
- Cumulative: SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) = 'end_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END) - MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) < 'start_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END))
- Multiple: SELECT DISTINCT person_column FROM table WHERE condition

Table "Rudi_Altig" columns: id, birth_date, birth_place, currentteam, death_date, death_place, discipline, fullname, majorwins, medaltemplates, name, proteam1, proteam2, proteam3, proteam4, proteam5, proteam6, proteam7, proyears1, proyears2, proyears3, proyears4, proyears5, proyears6, proyears7, ridertype, role, timestamp

10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

--- Question 18/50 ---
Entity/Table: Serhiy_Honchar
Question: How many more medals did Serhiy_Honchar won in 1997 compared to 2000?
Expected: 0
Detected Pattern: 1
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 1: Single Year Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cyclist
- Data Types: 2 numeric, 16 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:
- Ratio: SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, 1, INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL) / NULLIF(CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, INSTR(column_name, '/') + 1, INSTR(column_name, ' ') - INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL), 0)
- Ranking: SELECT CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(rank_column, 'st', ''), 'nd', ''), 'rd', ''), 'th', '') AS INTEGER)
- Cumulative: SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) = 'end_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END) - MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) < 'start_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END))
- Multiple: SELECT DISTINCT person_column FROM table WHERE condition

Table "Serhiy_Honchar" columns: id, birth_date, birth_place, country, currentteam, dateofbirth, discipline, fullname, height, image_caption, majorwins, medaltemplates, name, proteams, proyears, ridername, ridertype, role, timestamp, weight

--- Question 27/50 ---
Entity/Table: Luc_Leblanc
Question: How many years did Luc_Leblanc played for Le Groupement?
Expected: 1
Detected Pattern: 1
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 1: Single Year Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cyclist
- Data Types: 4 numeric, 17 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:
- Ratio: SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, 1, INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL) / NULLIF(CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, INSTR(column_name, '/') + 1, INSTR(column_name, ' ') - INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL), 0)
