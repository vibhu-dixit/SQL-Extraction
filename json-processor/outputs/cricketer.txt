--- Question 1/50 ---
Entity/Table: James_Franklin_(cricketer)
Question: How many 50s did James Franklin score in ODI from 2012 to 2016?
Expected: 1
Detected Pattern: 2
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 2: Date Range Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 39 numeric, 20 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:
- Ratio: SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, 1, INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL) / NULLIF(CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, INSTR(column_name, '/') + 1, INSTR(column_name, ' ') - INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL), 0)
- Ranking: SELECT CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(rank_column, 'st', ''), 'nd', ''), 'rd', ''), 'th', '') AS INTEGER)
- Cumulative: SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) = 'end_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END) - MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) < 'start_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END))
- Multiple: SELECT DISTINCT person_column FROM table WHERE condition

Entity/Table: Parthiv_Patel
Question: How many 100s did Parthiv Patel score in FC from 2011 to 2014?
Expected: 3
Detected Pattern: 2
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 2: Date Range Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 20 numeric, 30 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 2: Date Range Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 26 numeric, 11 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:

Entity/Table: James_Franklin_(cricketer)
Question: How many wickets did James Franklin took in Test in 2013?
Expected: 1
Detected Pattern: 1
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 1: Single Year Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 39 numeric, 20 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:

- Ranking: SELECT CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(rank_column, 'st', ''), 'nd', ''), 'rd', ''), 'th', '') AS INTEGER)
- Cumulative: SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) = 'end_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END) - MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) < 'start_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END))

Question: How many 50s did Ed Cowan score in LA from 2012 to 2018?
Expected: 2
Detected Pattern: 2
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 2: Date Range Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 23 numeric, 37 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 2: Date Range Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 23 numeric, 26 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER

9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
10. RANKING FORMATS: Strip ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) from rankings using REPLACE() before CAST to INTEGER
11. CUMULATIVE DATA: For "how many X between Y1 and Y2" questions, calculate (MAX(end_year) - MAX(before_start_year))
12. MULTIPLE ANSWERS: Use DISTINCT when question asks for "person(s)" or multiple entities

DATA HANDLING EXAMPLES:
- "6.1%" stays as "6.1%" - don't convert to 0.061
- "decrease" stays as "decrease" - don't convert to number
- "$272 million" becomes 272000000 in calculations but stays as "$272 million" in results
- "2019, 2020" can be returned as "2019 2020" or "2019, 2020"

SPECIFIC FIX EXAMPLES:
- Ratio: SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, 1, INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL) / NULLIF(CAST(SUBSTR(column_name, INSTR(column_name, '/') + 1, INSTR(column_name, ' ') - INSTR(column_name, '/') - 1) AS REAL), 0)
- Ranking: SELECT CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(rank_column, 'st', ''), 'nd', ''), 'rd', ''), 'th', '') AS INTEGER)
- Cumulative: SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) = 'end_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END) - MAX(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', timestamp) < 'start_year' THEN CAST(numeric_column AS INTEGER) END))
- Multiple: SELECT DISTINCT person_column FROM table WHERE condition

Question: How many 50s did Nuwan Kulasekara score in FC in 2014?
Expected: 1
Detected Pattern: 1
Prompt: UNIVERSAL TEMPORAL REASONING (Accepts data as-is):

PATTERN 1: Single Year Single Metric

DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
- Domain Type: cricketer
- Data Types: 33 numeric, 17 text, 0 currency
- Has Timestamp: True

UNIVERSAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS accept data in whatever format it exists - do NOT force conversions
2. Use strftime('%Y', timestamp) to extract year from timestamp
3. For comparisons, use CAST() with REPLACE() to handle $, %, million, billion, trillion
4. For text values (like 'increase', 'decrease'), return them as-is
5. For multiple year answers, return all relevant years
6. For percentages, handle % symbol in calculations
7. For currency, handle $, million, billion, trillion in calculations
8. Never try to convert text to numbers unless the text is clearly numeric

CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON ERRORS:
9. RATIO CALCULATIONS: For "ratio" questions, parse "X/Y" format using SUBSTR and INSTR with '/' separator
